# Akismet API 

This repository contains the latest OpenAPI spec for the Akismet API.

We have created an OpenAPI spec.yml file adhering to the OpenAPI v3.0.3 specification, which describes the existing endpoints and data structures of our API. While the file remains readable for humans, we specifically chose the OpenAPI format because it can be easily consumed by various tools. By utilizing this schema file along with compatible software, you can interact with the API without the need to write any code yourself.

For example, you can import the specification into [SwaggerHub](https://github.com/Automattic/akismet-api/wiki/Using-the-Akismet-API-spec-with-SwaggerHub) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to experiment with the API. You can also generate code to work with the API automatically - we recommend [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) for this.
