# Akismet API 

This repository contains the latest OpenAPI spec for the Akismet API.

We have created an OpenAPI schema.yml file adhering to the OpenAPI v3 specification, which describes the existing endpoints and data structures of our API. While the file remains readable for humans, we specifically chose the OpenAPI format because it can be easily consumed by various tools. By utilizing this schema file along with compatible software, you can interact with the API without the need to write any code yourself.
